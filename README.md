# Accenture_Java
This contains only some codes for the Accenture Learning Portal
The intuitive and easy ones were done on the online IDE itself. Sorry for not making any subdivisions specifying which program belongs to which category. All codes are mixed and random. Bear with it.
NOTE: Please don't blindly copy the codes, the class names are different, plus the input output comments and urges are different. Refer to their question descriptions and do the silly cosmetic changes yourself.
